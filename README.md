**The world's only CQRS / ES framework that lets you pick your Flavour**


## Intro

Event Engine is a CQRS / EventSourcing framework for PHP to help you rapidly develop event sourced applications, while providing a path to refactor towards a richer domain model as needed. Customize Event Engine with Flavours. Choose between different programming styles.

## Choose Your Flavour

## Documentation

Source of the docs is managed in a separate [repo](https://github.com/event-engine/docs)

## Run Tests

Some tests require existence of prooph/event-store tests which are usually not installed due to `.gitattributes` excluding them.
Unfortunately, composer does not offer a reinstall command so we have to remove `prooph/event-store` package from the vendor folder
manually and install it again using `--prefer-source` flag.

```bash
$ rm -rf vendor/prooph/event-store
$ docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/app --user="$(id -u):$(id -g)" prooph/composer:7.2 install --prefer-source
```

## Supersedes Event Machine 

The first version of this project is called Event Machine and can be found in another repo: [https://github.com/proophsoftware/event-machine](https://github.com/proophsoftware/event-machine).

We had to change the name due to naming conflicts with other projects. In fact, Event Engine is a newer version of Event Machine using the same concepts.
